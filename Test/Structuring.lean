# Tests: structuring / combinator tactics ("and stuff")

The rule is deliberately strict: in non-terminal position only `have` is allowed (plus
`intro`, but only as the first tactic). Structuring tactics — focusing dots `·`, `case`,
`<;>`, `refine`, `constructor`, … — are therefore flagged when they are not the last tactic
of their sequence. These tests pin that behaviour down so a future relaxation is a visible,
deliberate change.

NOTE: descriptions are `--` comments; the only `/-- -/` on a `#guard_msgs` is its expected
message.
